### Brief

The application lets High School students keep track of community service hours. Both the volunteers and various not-for-profits would use the same site to communicate needs for service from the users. The audience thus is quite far-reaching given all of the volunteer needs currently in the US and the number of students applying to university or other programs where volunteering can make a positive difference. But for as important as volunteering is, it's often not too easy finding new volunteer opportunities, but that is where this application hopes to make a difference. The hope is this application with its matching of users and non-profit organizations while being free to use and easier than other solutions will make it a viable option for helping out both students and non-profit organizations.

### Audience

The audience of this application is targeted at high-school-aged students and non-profit organizations.

High school students often have many needs for keeping track and finding volunteer hours whether it be for listing their extracurricular activities on college/university applications, applying for scholarships/grants, meeting requirements for their church / youth group, or fulfilling any community service hours needed by their church. Given most high school aged students are very familiar with technology, this should have a wide reach and really be relevant to anyone needing to find/track community service hours.

For non-profit organizations, they have a vested interest in finding new volunteers to fulfill their mission. From the perspective of the application, any community/non-profit organization is relevant assuming they are often in need of new/more volunteers.

### Problem

The problem of high school aged students is a two-fold need of needing to find volunteer opportunities as well as needing to track their volunteer hours for any applications/scholarships/programs. While often the problem of many non-profit organizations is not having enough volunteers to accomplish their mission in a timely manner.

### Solution

This application is addressing the problem by making it very easy to match volunteers with non-profit organizations by providing a web-based place for students to search for volunteer opportunities, keep track of their hours in a digital record, and for non-profits to easily publish new opportunities that students might not otherwise know about.

### Unique Value Proposition

Unlike other somewhat similar sites in this segment, the site is free to use by both volunteers and non-profit organizations. The aim pursued is also simpler to ensure as wide of reach as possible of its user-base and not to be too intimidating or structured that may turn off some students from participating.
